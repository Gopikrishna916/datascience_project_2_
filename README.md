# 📊 Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements **Customer Segmentation** using **unsupervised machine learning (K-Means clustering)** to group customers based on their **purchase behavior**.  
The goal is to help businesses **understand customer patterns**, improve **targeted marketing**, and support **data-driven decision-making**.

The project was originally developed by another contributor and later **reviewed, improved, and professionally documented** to meet academic and industry standards.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Businesses often fail to personalize services because they treat all customers the same.  
This project solves that issue by:
- Identifying **distinct customer groups**
- Understanding **spending behavior**
- Enabling **strategic marketing and retention planning**

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess customer transaction data  
- Analyze customer purchase patterns  
- Segment customers using **K-Means clustering**  
- Visualize clusters and category distribution  
- Evaluate clustering performance using metrics  
- Save the trained model for reuse

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model Explanation

### 🔹 Algorithm Used: K-Means Clustering
K-Means is an **unsupervised learning algorithm** that partitions data into **K clusters** based on similarity.

### 🔹 Features Used
- **PurchaseAmount**
- **Month**

### 🔹 Model Workflow
```
Raw Data → Cleaning → Feature Selection → K-Means → Visualization → Evaluation → Model Saving
```
